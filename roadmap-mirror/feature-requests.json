Use avatar entities. You get 42 of them (go figure) and unless otherwise limited by a filter, no one can do **** to them (even admins can't delete them)!\n2. Use remote execution. This is more complicated so moving on.\n3. Edit what already exists.\n\nThat last one is the easiest so let's pick a domain called.... domain. Now, in this domain, we have a single cube and luck be with us that it's unlocked. Unlocked entities can always be manipulated, unless otherwise specified by the domain's or zone's filter.\n\nNow, can anyone tell me how one would normally edit an entity? Anyone? No?\n\nWhy, you use Entities.editEntities! All you need to know is the UUID, or the \"universally unique identifier,\" of the object we want to change. I won't go into detail how one would acquire our demonstration's cube, but any scripter worth their salt can think of a few ways. So for now, let's say the UUID is {fecc}.\n\nSo let's go ahead and troll the owner by scaling the cube!\n\nEntities.editEntities(\"{fecc}\",{dimensions:{x:10,y:1,z:10});\n\nAnd walla! Now we have a flat, 10x10 platform! And you can edit any property you desire with this. Position? Whirl it away! Collision? Make a virtual sandpit!\n\nNow now, I can hear a few of you in the back crying out, \"But how do we stop this?\" Right! There are a few ways!\n\n1. Lock your **** down, dumb***! Unless the user has lock permissions, they can't unlock it to edit it!\n2. Use a filter! Filters can moderate what edits are performed, so you could do something like this:\n```\nfunction filter(properties, filterType, originalProperties) {\nif (filterType === EDIT) {\nvar willWork = \n(properties.dimensions.x > 10) ||\n(properties.dimensions.y > 10) || \n(properties.dimensions.z > 10);\nreturn !willWork;\n}\nfilter.wantsOriginalProperties = false;\nfilter.wantsToFilterEdit = true;\n}```\nThis filter will prevent us from making any edits bigger than 10m in any direction! If we try to make it 20 x 5 x 5, it simply will not work!\n\nHand in the back, yes? \"But how do we stop people from making avatar entities?\" Good question, and High Fidelity seems to know not only how to stop it, but also check if the items are in fact certified goods. Ask them.\n\nPerson with a serious fit of anger. \"WHY YOU TELL EVERYONE HOW TO HACK MY DOMAIN?!\"\n\nNow now, calm down. Like I said, almost any scripter worth their salt already knew this. When it comes to manipulating objects, like say a watch or floating pet, we edit entities all the time. In fact, unless otherwise updated, objects that are grabbed are really executing an edit command to parent the entity to themselves! This is why if you ever grabbed a material, you'd find it started to effect you.\n\nNot to mention, compared to avatar theft, preventing people from editing in your domain is completely doable, but is also not malicious at all! It's built into the system itself as a core feature, and as more things become entity based (RIP Overlays), domain owners will just have to remember to lock things down or expect it to turn into a rocket that even Jebediah Kerman would find impressive.","postID":"5ca23a81a0d4a734378452d6","created":"2019-04-04T12:29:10.521Z","author":{"_id":"5c3d72651fe5286c47c937b7","created":"2019-01-15T05:40:53.190Z","name":"FlameSoulis","urlName":"flamesoulis"},"mentions":[],"viewerLike":false}],"voters":[{"_id":"5c3ec7c779dc78412073405a","name":"Lurks","urlName":"lurks","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c4a73d09012e811d03101fb","name":"Teneksi","urlName":"teneksi-1","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c68d838033bb15c16eb721f","name":"SUP3RFlyN1NJA","urlName":"sup3rflyn1nja","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c410b8e263d6c1fd612151c","name":"ejahner","urlName":"ejahner","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c8c5323681d4e7a6af0b51e","name":"nightspirit","urlName":"nightspirit","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3fc5620847043a99a1de9c","name":"RekoRed_","urlName":"rekored","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d77470cf108453e9c8eaa","name":"Nik","urlName":"nik-57","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c42366cad420173c0298b62","name":"EdenAngel","urlName":"edenangel","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3e464f64290e411a8fd055","name":"Lathe","urlName":"lathe","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c50542df9daae660f060192","name":"Morag","urlName":"morag","companies":[]}]},{"_id":"5ca0a14696cc92037d9ac57b","authorID":"5c3d72651fe5286c47c937b7","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","title":"Restore Master Volume in People (or put it in Audio)","trendingScore":2571.6242904225537,"urlName":"restore-master-volume-in-people-or-put-it-in-audio","statusChanged":"2019-03-31T11:15:18.460Z","status":"open","score":5,"maxScore":5,"imageURLs":[],"etaPublic":true,"eta":null,"details":"Yet another secret feature: no master volume in the people app!\n\nJust because push to talk was added doesn't substitute volume adjustment.

Do you also know that most people are unlikely to use it? The idea with content protection is to make it more annoying to copy something than it is worth just to buy legit without increasing the difficulty to use as a legit owner. Take a tour of how music distribution changed and you should see what I mean.\n\nI have offered High Fidelity a few basic options, in addition to the above suggestions, and we can all see the outcome. Hifi has been stating a demand for content and users but can't get both if content creators are unwilling to distribute on a platform that offers no protection and a platform that doesn't have content won't attract users.\n\nAt this time, the only benefit the marketplace has is to allow things to be purchased, but only offers protections for entities on a basic level. Avatars, despite past discussions regarding unique avatars forming identities, are given absolutely no protections nor the ability to inspect the authenticity of them. I have no reason to put any avatars on the marketplace, be it ones I personally own or ones that could be marketed with my connections, due to the lack of willingness to protect creators.","statusChangeID":null,"parentID":null,"likeCount":3,"internal":false,"imageURLs":[],"created":"2019-03-26T03:18:17.657Z","author":{"_id":"5c3d72651fe5286c47c937b7","created":"2019-01-15T05:40:53.190Z","name":"FlameSoulis","urlName":"flamesoulis"},"mentions":[],"viewerLike":false},{"_id":"5c9ada5084feec3abe6a9552","postID":"5c996447a5f0050362cce995","value":"I've just figured it out myself, its doable with 3 console commands.

There is no such thing as \"edit permission\". You can do this with a client script or a modified create script.\n\nThe nature of Hifi requires interactable objects to be unlocked, so you cant really lock everything. \nIf things were locked, theyd be static. You cant do anything with a locked entity, except unlock it, if you have the permission to do so. So LOCKED Entities do have domain level protection which is a good thing.\n\nHowever, for unlocked entities, this means you can apply any entity script to any unlocked object; unless the server denies you this through filters.\n\nEntity scripts are scripts that run locally on your client and allows it impact you, or command you to impact the world. So if you fire a flare gun up in the sky? You create the entity, simulate it, and definite the particle and light effects for other clients. Hook guns? it applies an force to your avatar, pushing it forward along the hookline.\n\nThis is how many things in High Fidelity works. You have an input and have an output. Make sense right? Flow.js is a fantastic example of a client script that animates your avatar depending on the your avatar and other avatars.\n\nCombined with Message Queue, you can do... many great things... and many unspeakable things with this.\nSuch as take over control of another user's actions. \nAnd if targeted to a specific user you can be them, at least according to the server.\n\nAll things great power comes with great responsibility; and with everyone having such power, you shouldn't just trust everyone.\n\n....\n\nScripts are the lifeblood of High Fidelity, without them we have the fun things, they sorta need to have the unferreted access;\nPermissions systems like SL or Android would be nice to have, but have architectural challenges ahead and may take years to establish, \nwhich does not address the short-term (even if alphas been discussing this longer than a few years).\n\nMost of this can be protected against via Entity Filters, and fairly all High Fidelity domains are protected by them,\nmeaning places like Spot and Bank are fairly secure, (i will keep poking ;) ).\nThese tend to work by only allowing certain edits (like position, rotation) to be trasmitted to other users, with everything else being \"locked\".\n\nBut Filters are an arcane art and not well documented for others to make full use of.\n\nThey are also not provided by default in the sandboxes provided to users.\n\n----\n\nSo.. If youd eliminate the client from running a malicious script, \nthen youd eliminate this attack vector: \n\nIt is a Matter of Trust. \nThus we need to be able to define that trust through Client Script Whitelists.\n\nThe white list should also be extendable by user, allowing one to add their own scripts to the list. But this should only affect that user.\n\nBy Default, what everyone should have theirs running at.\nYou should Only trust following scripts:\n\n1. Released (Stressing REVIEWED) marketplace scripts. (Marketplace Authorized)\n2. Scripts or url domains that the domain say are ok. (Domain Authorized, or Required)\n3. Scripts from file system. (Local filesystem)\n\nUsers should be able to turn on / off which ever. If a domain requires scripts to run on the domain, they should be allowed to run on client. If client denies these from running then client should immediately disconnect and give a message to user that the domain requires the permission to connect. (This allows for gamelogic, and I think is already in place)\n\nThis can later be expanded upon with a permission system that analyses what commands the script will run; and if permissions are given, will allow it to be placed on the whitelist. Ofcourse there are some stuff that should never be allowed to go through such, such as presence of eval.\n\n\nThis does not eliminate bad actor domains, but it would put more control for the client. \nIT would also put more people in ease of not bumping into entities that may do something naughty with their clients.","deleted":false,"created":"2019-03-15T12:11:28.369Z","commentCount":1,"categoryID":null,"__v":0,"viewerVote":0,"board":{"_id":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","name":"Feature Requests","urlName":"feature-requests"},"mergeHistory":[],"linkedEntry":null,"category":null,"author":{"_id":"5c424f89aca8ba18ef7a5a8a","created":"2019-01-18T22:13:29.455Z","name":"Menithal","urlName":"menithal"},"comments":[{"_id":"5c8b9a6e7f3cb8421c89041c","postID":"5c8b96707f3cb8421c8903e2","value":"This","statusChangeID":null,"parentID":null,"likeCount":2,"internal":false,"imageURLs":[],"created":"2019-03-15T12:28:30.893Z","author":{"_id":"5c3dddbf64290e411a8f7eaa","created":"2019-01-15T13:18:55.014Z","name":"FluffyJenkins","urlName":"fluffyjenkins"},"mentions":[],"viewerLike":false}],"voters":[{"_id":"5c3d77470cf108453e9c8eaa","name":"Nik","urlName":"nik-57","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3e9a7a64290e411a8ff420","name":"Alezia.Kurdis","urlName":"aleziakurdis","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3e464f64290e411a8fd055","name":"Lathe","urlName":"lathe","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3ddacbd198ab4144c5e987","name":"krougeau","urlName":"krougeau","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3ddf5c46a3e370a75b8721","name":"Silverfish","urlName":"silverfish","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c41054280be431f890be625","name":"123.Basinsky.321","urlName":"123basinsky321","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d462b0cf108453e9c82f3","name":"Tim.Crook","urlName":"timcrook","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d83417b85746ca2605437","name":"Maki","urlName":"maki-3","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c4109cf3694482d49662675","name":"bigtin","urlName":"bigtin","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3e67ecd198ab4144c64248","name":"Marcus.Llewellyn","urlName":"marcusllewellyn-1","companies":[]}],"statusHistory":[]},{"_id":"5c8ae6d9e001ae269018183b","authorID":"5c3e464f64290e411a8fd055","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","title":"ability to move camera independently of avatar","trendingScore":2572.9566024931023,"urlName":"ability-to-move-camera-independently-of-avatar","statusChanged":"2019-04-12T00:09:31.615Z","status":"planned","score":13,"maxScore":13,"imageURLs":[],"etaPublic":true,"eta":null,"details":"This would be particularly useful when building wearable attachment points for marketplace items. \n\nIt seems the best way currently is to go into the create menu to move things around, but the camera is still locked in all modes other than ~\"move with avatar\".\n\nWhen looking at the avatar or things worn by the avatar being able to move the camera would be superb.\n\nPerhaps I am missing something and a recommended workflow exists already?

These properties all involve the marketplace certification system to help prove authenticity and help avoid copying in normal use cases (ignoring URL acquisition and what not).\n\nWhat I propose is having a similar set of conditions to be passed to the avatar class (Avatar/MyAvatar). This could then be coupled into the avatar mixer, where if a certified marketplace avatar is worn, only the owner can wear it. If a user copies the skeletonURL to themselves, the avatar mixer could deny its use, either by showing a woodie avatar (in T-Pose to avoid joint index differences) and/or other action (informing the client the URL is invalid).\n\nIn addition, this would help pave the way for \"Make Avatar Certificates readable\" (http://roadmap.highfidelity.com/feature-requests/p/make-avatar-certificates-readable) while beginning to put the initial steps towards avatar security, as at this time, nothing stops a user from wearing a certified avatar they don't own. This could also introduce a new domain-server property to only allow certified avatars much like the ability to (temp)Rez certified items vs normal (temp)Rez.","deleted":false,"created":"2019-03-06T07:58:28.384Z","commentCount":0,"categoryID":null,"__v":0,"etaPublic":true,"viewerVote":0,"board":{"_id":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","name":"Feature Requests","urlName":"feature-requests"},"mergeHistory":[],"linkedEntry":null,"category":null,"author":{"_id":"5c3d72651fe5286c47c937b7","created":"2019-01-15T05:40:53.190Z","name":"FlameSoulis","urlName":"flamesoulis"},"statusHistory":[],"comments":[],"voters":[{"_id":"5c3d77470cf108453e9c8eaa","name":"Nik","urlName":"nik-57","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c424f89aca8ba18ef7a5a8a","name":"Menithal","urlName":"menithal","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c4a73d09012e811d03101fb","name":"Teneksi","urlName":"teneksi-1","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d83417b85746ca2605437","name":"Maki","urlName":"maki-3","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c50542df9daae660f060192","name":"Morag","urlName":"morag","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c42366cad420173c0298b62","name":"EdenAngel","urlName":"edenangel","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d8b5c77470b40916da013","name":"1029chris","urlName":"1029chris","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3ddacbd198ab4144c5e987","name":"krougeau","urlName":"krougeau","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c403f769ea30b54c0b8f471","name":"LosAngelesGraff","urlName":"losangelesgraff-1","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d7a40458a806c4178480e","name":"madman","urlName":"madman-1","companies":[]}]},{"_id":"5c7f6d904ecc862b2c53dee8","authorID":"5c3da30cf328106c8267a0fc","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","title":"Web entity optimisation/ revision","trendingScore":2568.2726840314426,"urlName":"web-entity-optimisation-revision","statusChanged":"2019-03-06T06:49:52.391Z","status":"open","score":7,"maxScore":7,"imageURLs":[],"eta":null,"details":"Is it possible for someone to revise the web entity in the create menu \nThere is the potential to do a lot with web entities, however they are causing connection issues.\nAlso extra features such as a back button would improve functionality.\nPIMP MY WEB ENTITY PLEASE :).","deleted":false,"created":"2019-03-06T06:49:52.390Z","commentCount":2,"categoryID":null,"__v":0,"etaPublic":true,"viewerVote":0,"board":{"_id":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","name":"Feature Requests","urlName":"feature-requests"},"mergeHistory":[],"linkedEntry":null,"category":null,"author":{"_id":"5c3da30cf328106c8267a0fc","created":"2019-01-15T09:08:28.292Z","name":"Project8vr","urlName":"project8vr"},"statusHistory":[],"voters":[{"_id":"5c50542df9daae660f060192","name":"Morag","urlName":"morag","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c68d838033bb15c16eb721f","name":"SUP3RFlyN1NJA","urlName":"sup3rflyn1nja","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c42366cad420173c0298b62","name":"EdenAngel","urlName":"edenangel","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3ddacbd198ab4144c5e987","name":"krougeau","urlName":"krougeau","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d72651fe5286c47c937b7","name":"FlameSoulis","urlName":"flamesoulis","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c403f769ea30b54c0b8f471","name":"LosAngelesGraff","urlName":"losangelesgraff-1","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3da30cf328106c8267a0fc","name":"Project8vr","urlName":"project8vr","companies":[]}],"comments":[{"_id":"5c7f753f12bd8e34f060f282","postID":"5c7f6d904ecc862b2c53dee8","value":"Would help to if the opposite side was not reversed. this would allow more people to gather around and use it, instead of all having to crowed around the front side.

While the handshake system is something I don't think can ever be solved easily, the best case of something allowing the camera angle to actually show who is in front of a user, assuming the other person is the same height (smaller avatars are naturally just not going to work).\n\nThe best I can compare to is Second Life's camera, which actually had the focus point more on the top of the head but with some additional height so it was pointed partly downward (if I had to guess, I'm thinking the look at point was at Hifi's equal of Head_TopEnd), allowing me to always see when someone was in front. Just having the camera higher up pretty makes this possible.\n\nEDIT: In other words, don't touch the scroll wheel: that's working fine as is.

The best examples of this UI are currently TheWave and Oculus Home. What's required for this is a visual way to scan through all the objects you own (and maybe directly marketplace too) and really easily place them in the scene.

As such, it allowed sims that sold 'junk' to be sold without issue as long as the advertisement did not show them in use. Things that would be used for porn would be in adult sims.\n\nThat being said, based on Hifi's current rating system would technically allow for this, since SL only had 3 teirs (PG, Mature, Adult) with Hifi having 5 (Everyone, Teen, Mature, Adult, and Unrated). In this case, Everyone would be PG; Teen would be no nude, but more risque would be okay; Mature would match SL's mature (tits are okay, but don't juggle them), with Adult filling out the obvious. The only one that would be up for debate is Unrated.\n\nWith all that being said, as High Fidelity Inc operates the current placename ICE system, it would be up to them to establish the rules of the varying maturity ratings. Obviously, having the marketplace system follow it would create a tough issue for Mature and Adult due to how close of a threshold each is at (17+ vs 18+), which could impact domain operation as well (assuming the domain operator isn't limited to a Mature domain only allowing up to Mature items when some items could be viewed or advertised as Adult when not actually used up to that rating).","statusChangeID":null,"parentID":"5c65c18fc5792071b3ed3870","imageURLs":[],"created":"2019-02-22T10:35:42.237Z","likeCount":0,"internal":false,"author":{"_id":"5c3d72651fe5286c47c937b7","created":"2019-01-15T05:40:53.190Z","name":"FlameSoulis","urlName":"flamesoulis"},"mentions":[{"_id":"5c3d8b5c77470b40916da013","created":"2019-01-15T07:27:24.835Z","name":"1029chris","urlName":"1029chris"}],"viewerLike":false},{"_id":"5c70b1e919a290224fb39562","postID":"5c5ccd12be628d6baf0fa4d2","value":"@flamesoulis: What I meant is more like, what about a domain that only allows sexual stuff in a secluded area away from everyone else?

You then have to enter this coupon on the website to purchase the place name outside of VR.\n\nI tried this yesterday and hit on a couple of snags:\n\n-\tFirst, I learned the Oculus client does not implement the tablet UI in the Inventory app to conduct HFC transfers (I filed this as a bug). \n\n-\tThen, it was an awkward experience between the banker and I for him to give me the coupon code. I asked if there was a way for him to e-mail it to me and he said that wasn’t something available to him. So instead he wrote it on a text box and held up a sign with the code. I took a snapshot of it and saved it to my desktop. Of course, as an image this means I can’t just copy/paste it into the website.\n\n-\tOutside of VR, I then went to use the coupon code and the system informed me the coupon code was invalid. Now, the banker had just assured me he had a fresh batch of coupons but I didn’t think anything of it at the time. I contacted support and provided screenshots of the coupon code provided in-world and the error shown on the website when using the same code. They responded quickly with a new coupon code which worked. The support rep mentioned that the banker may have some stale coupons.\n\nSuggestions:\nI do like the personal touch of meeting with a banker in a nice environment. It gives the transaction a tangible feeling. I’d be great if the banker could easily fire off an e-mail with the coupon code for easy copy/pasting.\n\nAs an alternative, it’d be even more convenient if in the tablet UI where there is already an option to purchase a coupon with HFC would allow the purchase of a place name coupon. I asked the banker if this was an option and he informed me the coupon systems are different. Allowing the purchase from the tablet would avoid the need to set up a time to meet with the banker if it’s hard to find a good time that works.\n\nLastly, another option would be to have place name coupons available for purchase in the marketplace. This would make the process familiar to those who have already purchased from the marketplace or make it a great introduction to doing so.\n\nAnother enhancement to the above suggestions would be if upon purchase the system would recognize the coupon in the user’s inventory and allow it to be applied at purchase time automatically without having to enter the code. \n\nFurthermore, the next level would be allowing the user to choose the place name upon purchase in-world, allowing one to conduct the entire transaction without having to take off the VR headset.","deleted":false,"created":"2019-01-30T21:52:45.016Z","commentCount":0,"categoryID":null,"__v":0,"etaPublic":true,"viewerVote":0,"board":{"_id":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","name":"Feature Requests","urlName":"feature-requests"},"mergeHistory":[],"linkedEntry":null,"author":{"_id":"5c3ec4e7e4f7327ae3c86941","created":"2019-01-16T05:45:11.902Z","name":"Alberto","urlName":"alberto-29"},"category":null,"comments":[{"_id":"5c770f8a5eaa2f0bf4f3c7b1","postID":"5c521cad7b6ce762a2ba0767","value":"","statusChangeID":"5c770f8a5eaa2f0bf4f3c7af","parentID":null,"likeCount":0,"imageURLs":[],"created":"2019-02-27T22:30:34.292Z","internal":false,"author":{"_id":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","created":"2018-12-11T16:29:10.222Z","name":"Ashleigh Harris","urlName":"ashleigh-harris"},"mentions":[],"viewerLike":false}],"statusHistory":[{"_id":"5c770f8a5eaa2f0bf4f3c7af","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","changerID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","postID":"5c521cad7b6ce762a2ba0767","status":"under review","created":"2019-02-27T22:30:34.258Z","__v":0,"changer":{"_id":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","created":"2018-12-11T16:29:10.222Z","name":"Ashleigh Harris","urlName":"ashleigh-harris"}}],"voters":[{"_id":"5c3d77470cf108453e9c8eaa","name":"Nik","urlName":"nik-57","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d462b0cf108453e9c82f3","name":"Tim.Crook","urlName":"timcrook","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c70eb736a9e8a2255b76bb1","name":"Asher","urlName":"asher-5","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d83417b85746ca2605437","name":"Maki","urlName":"maki-3","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3e1d0ad719d47074a80cea","name":"Judas","urlName":"judas","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d72651fe5286c47c937b7","name":"FlameSoulis","urlName":"flamesoulis","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3e52c1d198ab4144c639c2","name":"PansyCraze","urlName":"pansycraze-1","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3dc4afe48ef44548669b58","name":"Zarniwoop","urlName":"zarniwoop-1","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3cf7e7e48ef44548664784","name":"Marcus.Llewellyn","urlName":"marcusllewellyn","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c403f769ea30b54c0b8f471","name":"LosAngelesGraff","urlName":"losangelesgraff-1","companies":[]}]},{"_id":"5c51c04b79c8bf62c29305fd","authorID":"5c51bd0c538e76117969c7a2","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","title":"User Interface 'layer'","trendingScore":2562.0528732809175,"urlName":"user-interface-layer","statusChanged":"2019-01-30T15:18:35.581Z","status":"open","score":2,"maxScore":2,"imageURLs":[],"eta":null,"details":"I just got a headset and twice got \"griefed\" by people standing so close to me that their body obscured the tablet so I had to move and in one case drop back to desktop to GOTO a different domain.

It even allows for Cisco's openh264 library to be dynamically linked, easing legal worries. Unfortunately, that's the only patented codec that can be dynamically linked in the Windows platform. CEF uses VideoLan's libraries for all of the other codecs, and on Windows there is no way to dynamically link these and offer them as a separate download for the user. You can do this for Linux, however.\n\nThe alternative when staying with Qt components is to make use of QtMultiMedia and create a dedicated media entity. The upside to this approach is that no codecs need be provided by High Fidelity. In this case, Qt uses the operating system's underlying media engine to output video or audio. This means WMF or Directshow on Windows, gstreamer on Linux, or AVFoundation on Mac.\n\nOf course there's a catch, at least on Windows. QtMultiMedia defaults to using Directshow, which isn't ideal. To make things as simple as possible for end users, WMF needs to be the default engine.","statusChangeID":null,"parentID":null,"imageURLs":[],"created":"2019-01-30T19:10:42.186Z","likeCount":0,"internal":false,"author":{"_id":"5c3cf7e7e48ef44548664784","created":"2019-01-14T20:58:15.368Z","name":"Marcus.Llewellyn","urlName":"marcusllewellyn"},"mentions":[],"viewerLike":false},{"_id":"5c620949da82d512f29fcc86","postID":"5c3edc1664290e411a9005db","value":"Currently scoping","statusChangeID":"5c620949da82d512f29fcc84","parentID":null,"imageURLs":[],"created":"2019-02-11T23:46:17.521Z","likeCount":0,"internal":false,"author":{"_id":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","created":"2018-12-11T16:29:10.222Z","name":"Ashleigh Harris","urlName":"ashleigh-harris"},"mentions":[],"viewerLike":false}],"voters":[{"_id":"5c3d83210cf108453e9c92cf","name":"GeorgeDeac","urlName":"georgedeac-1","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c41054280be431f890be625","name":"123.Basinsky.321","urlName":"123basinsky321","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3e664379dc78412073287c","name":"Kaylee_West","urlName":"kayleewest","companies":[]},{"_id":"5ae9aa7f1fd6d70cfbc8a61c","name":"Revo Fire","urlName":"revo-fire","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c7878594d001a398936d22f","name":"sevenrings","urlName":"sevenrings","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c416fbbea3fb310f8a41602","name":"billmar","urlName":"billmar","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3da30cf328106c8267a0fc","name":"Project8vr","urlName":"project8vr","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c53f84590b655124748e13f","name":"DAVEKAM","urlName":"davekam","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3dddbf64290e411a8f7eaa","name":"FluffyJenkins","urlName":"fluffyjenkins","companies":[]},{"_id":"5c3d462b0cf108453e9c82f3","name":"Tim.Crook","urlName":"timcrook","companies":[]}],"statusHistory":[{"_id":"5c3fb83f3812f77f5b2a8b78","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","changerID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","postID":"5c3edc1664290e411a9005db","status":"under review","created":"2019-01-16T23:03:27.582Z","__v":0,"changer":{"_id":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","created":"2018-12-11T16:29:10.222Z","name":"Ashleigh Harris","urlName":"ashleigh-harris"}},{"_id":"5c620949da82d512f29fcc84","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","changerID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","postID":"5c3edc1664290e411a9005db","status":"planned","created":"2019-02-11T23:46:17.467Z","__v":0,"changer":{"_id":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","created":"2018-12-11T16:29:10.222Z","name":"Ashleigh Harris","urlName":"ashleigh-harris"}}]},{"_id":"5c3ea8abd719d47074a84f9f","authorID":"5c3e9a7a64290e411a8ff420","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","title":"Have a \"Teleport Allowed\" flag on the Zone entity.","trendingScore":2563.924880076179,"urlName":"have-a-teleport-allowed-flag-on-the-zone-entity","statusChanged":"2019-01-25T01:47:48.785Z","status":"planned","score":13,"maxScore":13,"imageURLs":[],"details":"To be able to force people to not used teleportation mode to cheat in some eventual game in-world.","deleted":false,"created":"2019-01-16T03:44:43.990Z","commentCount":3,"categoryID":null,"__v":0,"etaPublic":true,"viewerVote":0,"board":{"_id":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","name":"Feature Requests","urlName":"feature-requests"},"mergeHistory":[],"linkedEntry":null,"category":null,"author":{"_id":"5c3e9a7a64290e411a8ff420","created":"2019-01-16T02:44:10.363Z","name":"Alezia.Kurdis","urlName":"aleziakurdis"},"statusHistory":[{"_id":"5c4a6ac44e9048118ce227b5","boardID":"5c0fe5ecd5a3f043e00d0c67","changerID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","companyID":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4d","postID":"5c3ea8abd719d47074a84f9f","status":"planned","created":"2019-01-25T01:47:48.790Z","__v":0,"changer":{"_id":"5c0fe5d6da74cb43c05bce4b","created":"2018-12-11T16:29:10.222Z","name":"Ashleigh Harris","urlName":"ashleigh-harris"}}],"comments":[{"_id":"5c4a6a92a311ad11d60d2424","postID":"5c3ea8abd719d47074a84f9f","value":"We definitely need to control the speed of avatars in a zone or server.
